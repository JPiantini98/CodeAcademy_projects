Hi Stranger! My name is Jorge and Welcome to my Responsive Desing code for my Web Developer Course in CodeAcademy.
This has being my best one yet, and I know is not a big deal but my work its getting cleaner an better. This is suppost
to be a website which content would always display right no matter the size of the screen you could whatch it. Hope you
can see it and tell me your toughts about it.

Feel free to contact me if you have any suggestion, please it could be really helpful to me 
and I really want to become better at this.

This is my email(in case you want to contact me): jmpf98@gmail.com

Thanks for taking the time to see my code, I really appreciate it! :D
