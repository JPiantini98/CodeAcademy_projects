        <h3>About me:</h3>
        <p>Hi! I'm Jorge Piantini, just a simple Citizen of the world.<br> I'm from Dominican Republic, a little island
            in the Carribean but with everything you can imagine inside (everything but snow :c I had never seen snow).
            I really love my country but the world is such a fascinating place that some day, I hope that I'll be able to know it better
            by traveling to all kinds of countries and learning about all different cultures, eating a lot of delicious
            food and taking beautiful pictures.
