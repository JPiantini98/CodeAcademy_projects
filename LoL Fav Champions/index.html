        <h3>The Rouge Assasing</h3>
        <p>She has struggle a lot since her rework and the reason for this is becasuse she's UNSTOPPABLE.
            Incredible hard to balance for the Riot Company but for me, she's the MOST FUN champion to play
            with. <span>Cost: 3150 Blue Scence or 790 RP</span>
        </p>

        <h2 id="irelia" class="championDiv">Irelia</h2>

            <img id="champPhoto" src="./resources/images/Irelia.jpg" alt="Irelia, The Blace Dancer"></a>
        <h3>The Blade Dancer</h3>
        <p>The QUEEN of blades, if you are the kind of people that like snowballing power you DEFINATALY 
            gotta play Irelia. Charge your passive and you are half way to winning that 1v1. An Incredible
            fun champion but is SO NOT noob friendly, but once you master her, she's SO worth it.

        <h3>Empress of the Elements</h3>
        <p>Oh Qiyana!, or as I call her, Qiqi she's an arrogant, agile, strong girl that would kill
            anyone in here way. One shooting people is her specialty and I LOVE IT. She can control three
            elements, Ice, Rock and Grass, three different flavors that would let you be as creative as you
            want. <span>Cost: 6300 Blue Scence or 975 RP</span>
