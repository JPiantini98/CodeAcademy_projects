Hi Stranger! My name is Jorge and Welcome to my Dising System code for my Web Developer Course in CodeAcademy.
I think I'm getting better at this. In this code is like a guide sheet for the desings of future projects.
Being honest, I don't think I'm going to use it exactly like it says but I needed to practice by making something so
here it is.

Feel free to contact me if you have any suggestion, please it could be really helpful to me 
and I really want to become better at this.

This is my email(in case you want to contact me): jmpf98@gmail.com

Thanks for taking the time to see my code, I really apreciate it! :D
